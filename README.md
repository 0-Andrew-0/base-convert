# Base Converter

GUI app made with Python and Kivy.

Convert values between Decimal, Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal.

It's a simple base converter and it doesn't work with fractional value; more of a demonstration of what gui with Python.

In my opinion making a webapp is a better option because of cross platform availability and easier implementation.
